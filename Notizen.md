# Questions
- How plausible is RE as a method of justification in philosophy?
- How practicable is RE, in particular for non-ideal agents?
- to what extent does RE reduce disagreement between different agents?
- What are the meta-ethical implications of RE, if it is applied to judgements about reasons?

# critique

- implausible account of justification. Intuitions are unjustified or unreliable. If the input is not reliable, then the output cannot be.
    - conservativism.
    - trivial
- impracticable.
    - cannot reach RE
    - cannot know if you reached it
    - too demanding
- not powerful enough to guarantee a objectivist reading of a domain of discourse.
    - does not produce consensus when starting from different $c_0$ and is therefore not objective.

## Plausible method of justification? Trade-offs between theoretical virtues in RE
Does RE define a plausible ideal of justification? epistemic values help us justify theories: consistency, empirical adequacy, simplicity, scope and explanatory power.
Do the desiderata implicit in RE have counterparts among the theoretical virtues for scientific theories? If not, is there a plausible explanation for this and can we nevertheless vindicate the desiderata? Second, are there plausible theoretical virtues in the philosophy of science literature that are not included in the desiderata implicit in RE? If not, is there a plausible explanation for this?
## A progress of commitments? On the process of equilibration under realistic circumstances
When is a fixed point reached that is not a global optimum? Under which circumstances? Should we branch?
## Agreement secured or disagreement stabilized? RE and consensus formation
